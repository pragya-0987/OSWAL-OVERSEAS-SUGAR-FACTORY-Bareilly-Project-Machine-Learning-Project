Project: Grower Supply Prediction at Oswal Sugar Factory
Overview
This project applies Machine Learning and data analytics to a real-world, final-year BCA internship dataset from Oswal Overseas Ltd. Sugar Factory. The primary objective was to analyze grower data (25,264 records across 36 columns) and build a predictive model to forecast the volume of sugarcane supply expected from contracted growers in the upcoming season.

Key Contributions:
Real-World Data Experience: Successfully worked with live, operational grower data provided by the company's EDP Department.

Data Analysis and Insights: Performed extensive data analysis to extract meaningful insights on grower behavior, land utilization, and past supply patterns.

Predictive Modeling: Developed a model to predict next year's supply volume, providing the factory with a crucial forecasting tool for planning and logistics.
